Developed in 100% React Native, "The Comedy Companion" is the world's first productivity tool for Stand-Up Comedians. Manage your jokes, organize them into set lists, and track performances all in one place.

### Upcoming Features

- Cloud Storage for Android Users
- Customizable Categories, and filtering on those categories
- Running rating of Joke performance by swiping left for good, right for bad on a given show
- Web Browser editing of jokes through a websocket API

### Currently Available Features (v1.4)

- Email Export of Jokes, Set Lists, and Show recordings
- Associate an Audio Recording with any Given Show
- Track solid bits as well as those you're currently working on
- Associate detailed notes with each bit
- Associate a length in minutes and seconds with each joke and estimate set list lengths as you build them
- Create set lists with ease, dragging and dropping jokes into place, and track their estimated length
- Track every show you perform, which set list was used, the venue performed at including city and state
- Reorder everything on the fly as well as search for specific keywords in your bits
- Back everything up to your personal iCloud account for security and ease of transferring data between multiple iPhones and iPads (iOS Users Only)

### Installation Instructions

Installation should be ridiculously simple once you are set up for React Native development ([Getting Started With React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)) . Simply clone the repository into whatever folder you like, go into that folder and type:

```
npm install
```

Once all the packages are done installing you should be able to simply type `react-native-run-ios` or `react-native-run-android` and the app should boot up in a simulator.

### Development Instructions

Please make all your pull requests on the `develop` branch. They will be merged in after review and releases will be cut from development to master whenever a group of features is deemed ready to go.
